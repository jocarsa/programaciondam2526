One of the most fun things about remote applications is that I can add first of all what we're going to do now as many applications as I want and secondly what we'll do later is that I can create my own applications I can publish my own applications in this case what I'm going to do is going to consist of first of all going into Google I'm going to download an application and I'm going to check how I can add this application to the pool of applications that any user could use I'm going to look for an application a code editor that I usually use quite often called edit edita it's also for both Linux originally it was for Linux as well as for Windows as for Mac and obviously we're going to see a second and obviously in this case I'm going to download the version for Windows I'm going to download the binary for Windows 32 and in a few seconds we're going to see the destination in this case I would have to add it to the trusted sites zone and what I'm going to do directly is download crown the server the important thing though in this case is to keep in mind that to install a program and for it to be available to any user on the network it must be installed on the client not on the domain controller but on this computer that we have installed on this machine that we have installed and I specifically with the remote of this if it lets me and if it doesn't let me I will have to configure the options of trusted sites, that is, medium-low I will add Google and download the Chrome browser and once downloaded install it
